There is the call when they are flying which is very hurried and\\newlineshort. Then there is the \"where are you\" call which is long, slow and loud. But this sound\\newlinewas not like any I had ever heard. I went to get the binoculars to see if I could spot\\newlineanything. But, no luck. I still kept hearing this low talking sound. I had now totally\\newlinegiven up weeding. Finding this strange sound was going to be more fun. But where was it\\newlinecoming from? I looked again up and down the lake and saw nothing. Finally I went around to\\newlinethe other side of the place where we keep our boats. There is an area there where it is\\newlinenot a very deep part of the water. I spotted them! It was a mother lake bird and a father\\newlinelake bird with a baby in between them. They were teaching the baby how to swim and eat\\newlinefish. The low talking sound that I heard must have been them trying to teach the baby to\\newlineswim and eat the fish. I sat there on the bank and watched for a half an hour.
