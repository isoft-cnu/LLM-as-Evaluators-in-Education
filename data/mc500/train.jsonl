In fact, John's whole family, including his mother Stephanie, his father Bob, and his brother James loved to eat peaches. John would eat peaches in the morning for breakfast, in the afternoon for lunch, and in the evening for dinner. John and his best friend, Rick, shared their love for peaches. One day John and Rick started a peach farm so that they would never run out of their favorite fruit. They planted hundreds of peach trees and waited for them to bear fruit. After 6 years of waiting, 1 lonely peach finally grew on one of the trees John and Rick planted. They picked the peach and brought it home. They waited until the weekend to eat it in case more peaches grew, but none did. John and Rick were sad and confused about their farm. They planted hundreds of trees and were sure that there would be thousands of peaches for them to eat in no time. Another peach never grew on their farm for 17 years.

That was a lot of work. \\newlineSusan was going back in the house for lunch when she saw that the light in the hall was out. She asked her grandmother to show her where the light bulbs were at so that she could change it. Since she was so short she had to get a stool to stand on.

Every day when the sun came up Max would run down to the stop and wait until the train stopped and jump on. He thought this was the best time of his life. He always wore a blue collar and a red piece of fabric. Except for on the weekends he would wear a green collar. Sometimes when Max would run next to the train, he would get a splash of mud on his fur. His friend, Bob, didn't like it when Max came home dirty. If Max came home with mud on his fur, Bob would make him sleep outside for the night, but if Max came home clean he would sleep in the house.

She had two dogs, a brother, a sister, and a mom and dad.  Every day she woke up and went to kindergarten, played outside, and watched movies.  Sometimes her family would go to a rollercoaster park.  Her mom would always try to get her to ride the big rides but she was afraid and wanted to stay in Snoopyland.  For two years she stayed in the little kid section of the park.  Her big brother who had to babysit her was getting mad because she would not try new rides.  She cried more and more until one day she got brave.  She went on a little bigger musical ride that went around in circles pretty fast.  She got off the ride and loved it!  Her mom said to her, \"Okay, let's go on the big kid rides now!\"  Megan was afraid again and cried and cried.  For the rest of that summer she stayed in the little kid section and went on little rides.  The next summer her brother brought his girlfriend home.  His girlfriend's name was Sara and she was older, and loved big rides.  Megan liked Sara a lot and wanted to make her like her.  When Sara asked Megan if she would ride on bigger rides she said yes, and she went on her first real rollercoaster, Thunderhawk.  She was frightened at first but when she stepped off the ride she loved it like she had loved the other ride last year!  Now was the real test.  Sara asked Megan if she wanted to go on the biggest ride in the park.  She was afraid but wanted to show Sara how big she was.

He met Jessica one afternoon at a park on a hot summer day.  They both started talking and became great friends.  They spent the whole day together and ate their lunches together next to the pond.  Kevin sure enjoyed the park more than he liked going to the beach or store.  There were many ducks, frogs, birds and chipmunks playing around the pond.  In fact, one of the chipmunks even came up and stole Kevin's car keys when he was eating!  Kevin knew that he needed to go have his keys, but the chipmunk ran with an evil smile on its face.  Eventually, the chipmunk ran into its hole that he called home.  Kevin tried everything he could to have the chipmunk come out with his keys, but he couldn't find out how to make the little guy give up.  Finally, Jessica came over and placed a potato chip at the opening to the hole.

As we started heading up the hill to the truck, my granddaughter was scared by a bird who had swooped by her face. \"Nana, that bird almost made me fall down the hill!\" Laughing at what was said, I answered, \"If you fell you might have taken Nana down with you!\" Once we reached the ice cream truck, Tina saw that they not only had ice cream but also carried popcorn, hotdogs, juice and soda. \"Nana, instead of ice cream may I get popcorn and juice?\" she asked. \"If that is what you want, you sure can!\" I answered. We got our food and headed to the picnic table. On our way over we saw a child who Tina knew from her kindergarten class. \"Nana, may we go and say hello to Mary?\" \"Let's go!\" We made it over to where Mary and her family were sitting and Tina saw a bright blue butterfly. She did everything she could to try and catch that pretty butterfly but it kept flying way to high for her to catch. \"That is okay\", she said, \"Butterflies need to be left out to fly free\".

His father's name was George, and he was 2 years older than Marge. Marge looked sad and told Jerry that George had left after he was born because the people in the town didn't like him. This made Jerry very sad. He went off to his corner of the car and didn't talk to Marge again until she went to bed. After she fell asleep he wanted to go out and look for his father. He packed some food and left. When Marge woke up she was upset, but she thought she knew where he had gone.", "properties": {"author": "1859599066", "work_time": 1353, "quality_score": 100, "creativity_words": ["monster", "adult", "build", "blood", "last", "tricycle", "blacking", "train", "orange", "racer", "sleep", "paper", "fish", "puppy", "party"]}, "answer_options": {"A": "11", "B": "2", "C": "36", "D": "100"}, "answer": "A", "question_is_multiple": false, "student_correct_response": "The answer is A: 11.", "student_incorrect_response": "The answer is C: 36."}

It could not be reached by plane, spaceship, car, or any other means of travel. The farm was run by large squirrels, and was started in 1032. They owned the planet the farm was on, called Etopit. In the year 2037, one brave man named Hugo wanted to travel to Etopit to see the farm. On Earth, it was known the squirrels grew better oranges than any other animal, including rabbits, dogs, and horses. Hugo wanted to learn the squirrels' secrets and bring them back to Earth. Hugo was no normal man. He could sneeze so hard that it would send him flying into the air. Hugo put on a squirrel costume, and had his friend Ralph tickle his nose for 7 hours. Hugo sneezed so hard he flew into space and landed in Etopit. The squirrels did not know he was a human because of his costume. Hugo met Rufus and Xenon, 2 of the most power squirrels in space.

He lives in a huge field during the summer, with beautiful, and tasty, buttercups and hay.  During the winter he lives in a nice, warm barn. \\newline\\newlineThe hay isn't as tasty then, but it keeps him fed until summer comes back.  One winter day Max wanted to see what was happening outside when it turned cold and bright. He had never gone out during the winter because the Farmer always locked the barn door behind him. But today the door was wide open, and Max could see the sunshine reflecting off the bright ground. He had to know why! So Max pushed open the gate to his little house with his nose and walked over to the door. Max was surprised and confused by the ground outside, it was so white and sparkly. His breath started fogging in the air, and the ground was cold and crunchy. \"What is this?\" He asked the rooster sitting on the fence. The roosters name was Omaha, and he was all white except for a big red puff on his head.  \\newline\\newline\"It's snow, son! Did you grow up in a barn?!\" The rooster laughed and flew away towards his little rooster house. \\newline\\newline\"It's so pretty!\" Max said. He pushed it with his nose. \"Oh!

The tree grew next to a river in a large, green forest. Twinkles loved to fly around the forest with her best friend Betsy the Bat. Betsy was a very forgetful bat. One day Twinkles and Betsy were playing next to the bushes by the river bank when Betsy shouted, \"Oh no, I've forgotten my lunch that my mom packed for me today! It is late in the afternoon and I am hungry.\"\\newline\\newline\"Do not worry,\" said Twinkles. \"I am going to wait here for you until you get back.\"\\newline\\newlineWith that, Betsy flew off toward her home in the wet cave near the other end of the river. An hour went by and Betsy still had not returned. \"Hmm,\" thought Twinkles, \"I wonder where Betsy went off to.\" Twinkles flew off to find her best friend.\\newline\\newlineSoon, she heard a voice calling from down below. \"Help me! I'm stuck!\" Twinkles looked down. Sure enough, it was Betsy! She had been caught in a pile of sticky mud near the mouth of the cave. \\newline\\newline\"Don't worry, I am coming to save you!\" cried Twinkles. Twinkles swooped down to the ground. She found a strong stick nearby that she could use to help her pull Betsy out of the thick mud. Betsy grabbed the end of the stick that Twinkles held out to her. After some heavy tugging, Betsy was free.\\newline\\newline\"Thank you so very much for pulling me out of the mud! I was looking for some berries to use for jam down by the river. They grow on the bushes there. I wanted some for a little dessert after my lunch.

One afternoon Juno was out in the front yard playing tag with Sasha the kitten, when Billy came to fetch her for her bath.  Juno did not like baths very much and she ran away every time Billy got close to her.  Billy soon got tired of Juno's game, so he left her in the garden hoping she would keep running around and tire herself out.   Sasha the kitten followed Billy and Juno was surprised to find herself alone, she had hoped Billy would keep on playing this fun game.   To pass the time she watched some birds building a nest in a tree, Juno was so bored she even tried to play hide and seek with George, the parrot.  Finally, since there was nobody to play with Juno laid down to take a nap.\\newlineA little later Billy came back out into the yard to fetch Juno.   What Billy didn't know was, Juno had been sleeping since he left and she was ready for another game of catch me if you can, her favorite game.  Juno took off running as soon as she saw Billy.   Billy sat down on the grass to wait.  Billy found a ball and started to throw it for Juno to fetch.  Billy kept on throwing the ball and Juno kept on bringing it back until  Juno dropped the ball and lay down on the grass, panting, tired out.      Billy quickly slipped the collar and leash on her.   Billy got Juno on her feet and the two of them walked round to the back yard where the family were sitting outside enjoying the sunshine.   Billy's father called him to come and enjoy some ice cream with them but Billy said no, he'd rather get Juno's bath time over with and then he could enjoy his ice cream.   Billy knew he had to hurry or his brothers Allen and Greg would finish the Rocky Road ice cream which was Billy's favorite.\\newlineBilly tied Juno's leash to the fence and then he brought the hose over and switched it on.  Juno   immediately tried to run away but she had no choice but to stay there and let Billy soak her.   Billy quickly added soap to Juno's coat and soon she was covered in soapy suds.   Soon Billy once again turned the hose on Juno to rinse all the soap out of her coat.

{"idx": {"story": "mc500.train.294", "question": 0}, "question": "What did the house come with?", "story": "Maria was a teacher at a small school in Arizona. Maria had worked in the past at schools in California, Texas, and Vermont, but had to leave these schools because the school in Arizona was perfect for her dream job. When she moved to Arizona she found a small little one bedroom house that fit her perfectly. The house was on the top floor of another building, owned by another teacher. In her house was a bed, dresser, table and telephone. Nothing else came with the house. So Maria wanted to go shopping with her new teacher friend. So they went down to the mall to buy things for her new house. First she wanted to look for some chairs to go with her table. Then she wanted to find a TV for her living room and a TV for her bedroom. Last she wanted to find a big comfy couch for her living room. When she got to the couch store she had a few different choices. She could buy the biggest couch they had but would go over her limit, it was black. She could buy the middle couch right at her limit, which was brown. Or she could buy the smallest couch well under her limit, but was not a very good color, red. Maria went with the middle couch knowing she would not like the color of the smaller one even if it was least expensive.
